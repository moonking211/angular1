Support
=============

### Questions
- For general questions, (how do I ...? am I doing this right? etc...) please use [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?tab=Relevance&q=is%3aquestion%20-%5bangular-schema-form%5d%20angular%20schema%20form) and tag the question with [angular-schema-form](https://stackoverflow.com/search?tab=Relevance&q=is%3aquestion%20-%5bangular-schema-form%5d%20angular%20schema%20form), if there is not an answer soon, link to the SO ref in a message in the Gitter. I (Anthropic) have started using SO a lot more recently and should be able to help you there while making it easier for others to find the answers in future.

### Creating an issue
- We are an **open source project** and our members devote their **personal time** to try to help. As it could be time spent doing development **please try not to waste their time** with poorly written issues.
- Please search for related issues and reference anything that may be related to help us resolve your issue.
- Be sure you have properly read the documentation and understand the main concepts of ASF: https://github.com/json-schema-form/angular-schema-form/blob/development/docs/index.md
- Remember that you can **test** schemas and forms at http://schemaform.io/examples/bootstrap-example.html
- If applicable, **always provide a running example**, like a gist or a plunker, do not put code into the issue unless it is really basic and not more than a few lines formatted using markdown code blocks.
- **You can create a Gist from the example page.** It helps us to help you!
- You will not get a constructive response if the question is poorly described and not formatted to be readable.
- Items tagged as needing something "need: ..." will be closed unless we get a response within 2 weeks so please check back even if you don't get a notification email.
- You are always welcome to re-open a closed issue, we prefer that to opening a new one for the same thing.

### Gitter
All of our projects have Gitter, please ensure you discuss your problem in the apprpriate Gitter or you may not get a quick response to your problem.

We are **NOT** available for basic JavaScript support, please use Stack Overflow or similar support sites for basic support.
